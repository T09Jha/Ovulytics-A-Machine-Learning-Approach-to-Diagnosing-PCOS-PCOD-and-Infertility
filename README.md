# Ovulytics-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Diagnosing-PCOS-PCOD-and-Infertility
Ovulytics is a machine learning-based project aimed at diagnosing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD), and PCOS with infertility. This project utilizes three machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of these conditions based on clinical and biochemical data.

### PCOD Prediction Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle
**Size:** 162 records
**Features:**
- Menstrual and reproductive health indicators:
- Bleeding patterns
- Cycle length
- Ovulation day
- BMI
### PCOS with Infertility Dataset
**Source:** Private dataset
**Size:** 541 records, 6 features
**Features:**
- Key infertility indicators:
- Beta-HCG (I and II)
- AMH levels

## Data Preprocessing‚öôÔ∏è
To ensure high-quality and balanced input for model training, the following preprocessing techniques were applied:

**Outlier Detection and Removal:**
- Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Z-scores

**Data Standardization:**
- Scaled features to standard normal distribution for better model performance.
- Handling Class Imbalance:
- Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address imbalance between positive and negative cases.

**Feature Selection:**
- Implemented Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV).
- Key selected features include:
- Age
- Cycle length
- Hormonal levels

## Machine Learning Modelsü§ñ
Three machine learning models were used to predict PCOS, PCOD, and infertility:
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost
- Random Forest (Best Performing Model)
